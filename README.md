## Projects

### AWS 3-Tier Web Application Architecture 
![CI/CD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SNS-Srinivasu/portfolio/main/3-Tier.png) 

- Designed and deployed a secure, scalable 3-tier web application infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.
- The setup includes a VPC with public and private subnets across two Availability Zones, an Application Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances for the application layer, and an RDS MySQL database in the backend.
- Focused on high availability, fault tolerance, and cost-effective design.

### CI/CD Pipeline Using Jenkins, ECR, and EC2
![CI/CD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SNS-Srinivasu/portfolio/main/Diagram.png) 

- Jenkins Master: Runs in a Docker container, listens for GitHub webhooks, and orchestrates the pipeline.
- Jenkins Agent: Executes tasks like cloning the repository, building Docker images, and pushing them to Amazon ECR.
- Deployment Server: Automatically pulls the latest image from ECR, replaces the old container, and runs the updated application on port 8081.




### AWS EKS Deployment
![EKS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SNS-Srinivasu/portfolio/main/architecture.jpg)  

**Description:**  

- This project demonstrates the end-to-end setup and deployment of a containerized application on AWS EKS. 
- It covers the installation and configuration of key DevOps tools including AWS CLI, kubectl, eksctl, and Docker. 
- The workflow includes creating an EKS cluster, building Docker images, pushing them to Amazon ECR, and deploying the application using Kubernetes manifests. 
- This setup reflects real-world practices in modern cloud infrastructure and container orchestration.

### AWS Serverless To-Do App
![Serverless](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SNS-Srinivasu/portfolio/main/serverless.jpg)  

**Description:**  

- Built a serverless To-Do application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. 
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints to add and retrieve tasks, with Lambda functions written in Python and connected to a DynamoDB table. 
- The solution is fully deployed using API Gateway and demonstrates hands-on experience with serverless architecture and AWS services.

### High Availability Architecture on AWS
![HA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SNS-Srinivasu/portfolio/main/HA.jpeg)  

**Description:**  

- Designed and implemented a highly available and fault-tolerant web infrastructure using AWS services.
- Deployed EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones with Auto Scaling to handle variable traffic loads.
- Integrated an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for efficient request distribution and health checks.
- Used Route 53 for DNS management and domain routing to ensure high reliability.
- Applied Security Groups for controlled access and Amazon CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerts.
- This project highlights AWS best practices for building scalable, secure, and resilient cloud architectures.

### Secure VPC Network Architecture
![Networking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SNS-Srinivasu/portfolio/main/Networking.jpeg)  

**Description:**  

- Designed a secure and efficient VPC architecture in AWS using both public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
- Configured a public subnet with an EC2 instance connected via an Internet Gateway (IGW) for external access.
- Deployed a private subnet with an isolated EC2 instance, using a NAT Gateway to enable secure outbound internet access.
- Implemented route tables to control traffic flow‚Äîpublic subnet routing through the IGW, and private subnet through the NAT Gateway.
- This architecture demonstrates secure cloud networking principles with isolation, controlled access, and high availability.
